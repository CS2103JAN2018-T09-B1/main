== Introduction

_EduBuddy_ is designed for secondary school teachers who *prefer to use a desktop app to manage student profiles*.
More importantly, _EduBuddy_ is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a
Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, _EduBuddy_ can get your student profile management tasks done faster
than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[IMPORTANT]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `EduBuddy.jar` link:https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-T09-B1/main/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for _EduBuddy_.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+
image::UI.png[width="800"]
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list` or `l`* : lists all students
* **`add` or `a` **`n/John Doe p/91234567 ic/S9315585J t/1A t/20 sub/English B3` : adds a student named `John Doe` to _EduBuddy_
* **`delete` or `d`** `3` : deletes the 3rd student shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.
